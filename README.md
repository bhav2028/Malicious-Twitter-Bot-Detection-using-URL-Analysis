# Malicious Twitter Bot Detection Using URL Analysis

This project focuses on detecting malicious Twitter bots through URL-based analysis. By examining URLs shared in tweets and extracting meaningful features, the system classifies whether a tweet is likely generated by a malicious bot.

## Project Overview

Malicious bots often spread harmful content by sharing suspicious URLs. This project analyzes those URLs and tweet metadata to identify patterns associated with bot behavior.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Collected tweets and their associated URLs.
- Extracted metadata such as URL structure, domain characteristics, and tweet behavior.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- URL-based features:
  - URL length
  - Domain information
  - Presence of special characters
  - HTTP/HTTPS protocol
  - Redirect count
- Tweet-based features:
  - Account age
  - Tweet frequency
  - Followers-to-following ratio
  - Hashtag usage

### 3. Model Training
- Tested multiple machine learning algorithms.
- Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Classified tweets as either malicious bot or legitimate user.

### 4. Model Serialization
- Saved the final trained model using the pickle library.
- Generated a `model.pkl` file for future predictions.

### 5. Flask Deployment
- Developed a Flask web application for real-time predictions.
- The app loads the trained model and accepts URL or tweet data as input.
- Outputs whether the input is likely from a malicious bot.
